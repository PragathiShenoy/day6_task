1. The class Movie is stated below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class has the following three properties:

title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)
a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.

b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.

c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full.

d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”

Answer: 

class Movie {
    constructor(title, studio, rating) {
        this.title = title;
        this.studio = studio;
        //this.rating = rating;
        console.log(this.rating, rating)
    if (rating== undefined|| null){
        this.rating = "PG"
    } else{
        this.rating = rating;
    }
    }
    getPG(arr){
        let pgresult = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i].rating =="PG") {
                pgresult.push(arr[i]);
            }
        }
        return pgresult;    
    }
}

let film1 = new Movie("Casino Royale", "Eon Productions", "PG-13");
let film2 = new Movie("Casino Royale", "Eon Productions");
let film3= new Movie("PQR Royale", "Eon Productions", "PG-14");
let film4= new Movie("ABC Royale", "Mon Productions", "PG-24");
let film5= new Movie("XYZ Royale", "Kon Productions");
let film6= new Movie("LMN Royale", "Lon Productions", "PG-20");
let film7= new Movie("SMN Royale", "Ton Productions", "PG");

const array=[film1, film2, film3, film4, film5, film6, film7]

film1.getPG(array)
